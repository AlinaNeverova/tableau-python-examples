# Tableau Dashboard: Python-Based Correlation & Normality Analysis

This repository contains a Tableau workbook (`.twbx`) that demonstrates the integration of Python (via TabPy) into Tableau for statistical analysis.

## üîç Overview

The dashboard showcases how Python scripts can be used directly within Tableau to perform:

1. **Normality Testing**  
   - Method: Anderson-Darling test  
   - Function: `scipy.stats.anderson()`

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Method: Spearman‚Äôs Rank Correlation  
   - Function: `scipy.stats.spearmanr()`
